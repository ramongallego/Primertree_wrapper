## Data

Try keep them on plain text (`.fasta`, .txt, or stuff like that) so software updates and incompatibilities don't kill the future use of your project.

If they are too big, (> 50MB), then add the folder into .gitignore so you can keep using version control. A link to a bi file repository (Gdrive...) woud be useful too.

The general idea is to leave raw data **unmodified** so there is more transparency and reproducibility in the whole process.
