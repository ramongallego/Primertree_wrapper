These should be a set of one-trick ponies. One script gets one kind of input and produces a consistent output or error.

THe simpler they are, the easier it will be to recycle them into another project.

These should be able to be sourced by a higher script.  If there are two many of them, and they are in R, maybe better to make an R package? Up to you
