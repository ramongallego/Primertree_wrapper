## Manuscript (Copied from Jimmy's original repository)

  This should probably *never* contain a manuscript file right in this directory -- if you are doing science, you are certain to end up with many versions from many authors. Some people let their version control system (e.g. git, svn) handle all of the versions, but this isn't friendly to non-VCS types and can be a pain upon dealing with manuscript submission and formatting. I prefer to keep each version in it's own subdirectory. In line with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for software, I try to use the first digit for "major releases" (i.e. journal submissions) and the second digit for "minor releases" (i.e. internal revisions). v0.1 is the very first draft, and after each time you circulate the manuscript and get feedback from coauthors, you should start a new internal version (I have sometimes used v0.0 to indicate a *very* rough draft. I'm actually not sure whether v0.0 or v0.1 should be preferred). If you want to store internal (i.e. to you, the project manager) iterations, those should be noted in a third digit place, e.g. v0.2.2.

  Here is an example workflow:

  - *v0.1*: The very first draft. Send a link to the directory to coauthors. They comment and make changes. You copy the directory and name the copy...

  - *v0.2*: Now you incorporate everybody's changes, and send a link to the manuscript back out. Everyone agrees, *this* version is now flawless. You copy the directory and rename it...

  - *v1.0*: This is the version you send to Science. You now also have a file in here for the cover letter. Science rejects it outright. You copy this directory and rename it...

  - *v2.0*: This is the version you submit to Nature. It goes out for review, but gets rejected with encouragement to resubmit. So, you copy this directory and rename it...

  - *v2.1*: Now you also add a file containing the reviews and a file containing your responses. You make changes to the manuscript, send it to coauthors, some of whom acknowledge your email, and one of whom makes a few changes. So you copy the directory, and rename it...

  - *v2.2*: This is the version you send back to Nature, with your revised cover letter and response to reviews. Nature rejects it, so you copy and rename it...

  - *v3.0*: This is the version you send to PNAS...

  - ...

  - *v28.4*: This is the final iteration of responding to reviewers at the Southwestern Oklahoma Journal of Oceanography.

  - *vPUBLISHED*: Your article has been ACCEPTED! This is where you put the final author's proofs and copyediting bullshittery. You can now archive this whole directory, write it to a floppy disk, and throw it in the garbage (or e-cycling, where facilities exist). Congratulations! Science!
